## Engram Cogitator (Persistent Memory)

This project uses EC for cross-session memory. Relevant memories are auto-loaded at session start.

**Tools available:**
- `ec_add` - Store a memory (decision/learning/pattern)
- `ec_search` - Find relevant memories semantically
- `ec_list` - List recent memories
- `ec_invalidate` - Soft-delete outdated memories

**When to store:** Use the `ec:remember` skill when you make architectural decisions, discover gotchas, learn something project-specific that would be useful in future sessions, or when the user tells you to remember something.

**Don't store:** Obvious things, temporary fixes, or duplicates (search first).
